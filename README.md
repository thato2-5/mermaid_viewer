# Mermaid Diagram Collection

> **Flask App displays and visualizes Mermaid.js diagrams from a text file, providing an interactive web interface to browse, search and explore technical diagrams like system architectures, database schemas and flowcharts. Users can view each diagram with zoom controls, copy the mermaid code, download diagramms as SVG files and navigate between different types through dedicated routes**

## Structure of mermaid_ref.txt:

```text
#no Title
[blank_line]
mermaid code here
[blank_line]
```

This helps ensure that the diagramms are successfully parsed to the API.
